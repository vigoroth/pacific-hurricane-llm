The **1975 Pacific hurricane season** officially started May 15, 1975, in the
eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1975, in the central Pacific, and lasted until
November 30, 1975. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year
when most [tropical cyclones](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone "Tropical cyclone") form
in the northeast [Pacific Ocean](/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean").[1]

The 1975 Pacific hurricane season was slightly above average, with 17 tropical
storms forming. Of these, 9 became hurricanes, and 4 became major hurricanes
by reaching Category 3 or higher on the [Saffir-Simpson Hurricane
Scale](/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale "Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale").
The only notable storms are [Hurricane Olivia](/wiki/Hurricane_Olivia_\(1975\)
"Hurricane Olivia \(1975\)"), which killed 30 people, caused $30 million (1975
USD) in damage, and left thousands homeless when it made landfall in October;
and an unnamed hurricane that developed at very high latitude, but had no
effect on land. Hurricane Denise was the strongest storm of the year.
Hurricanes Lily and Katrina passed close to [Socorro
Island](/wiki/Socorro_Island "Socorro Island") and Tropical Storm Eleanor made
landfall in [Mexico](/wiki/Mexico "Mexico"). Hurricane Agatha sank a ship.

## Season summary

"Edit section: Season summary")]

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/6xi1r25hwnwz00aso5hh213i31iwpyk.png)

The season began with the formation of Tropical Depression One on June 2 and
ended with the extratropical transition of Tropical Storm Priscilla on
November 7. No named systems formed in May, two in June, four in July, six in
August, three in September, one in October, and one in November.[2] The total
length of the season, from the formation of the first depression to the
dissipation of the last, was 158 days.

In the eastern Pacific (east of [140°W](/wiki/140th_meridian_west "140th
meridian west")), sixteen tropical storms and eight hurricanes formed. Four of
the hurricanes became major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 or higher on the
[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale](/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale "Saffir-
Simpson Hurricane Scale").[2] These numbers are close to the long-term
averages of fifteen tropical storms, nine hurricanes, and four major
hurricanes.[3] There were also four unnamed tropical depressions.[4] The only
system to enter or form in the central Pacific (between 140°W and the
[international dateline](/wiki/International_dateline "International
dateline")) was an unusual high-latitude hurricane (north of
[30°N](/wiki/30th_parallel_north "30th parallel north")), which went unnamed.
This was the first occurrence on record of a mid-Pacific upper tropospheric
low developing into a tropical cyclone, and the first hurricane on record
within the central Pacific north of Hawaii.[5]

The only systems to make landfall this year were Tropical Storm Eleanor and
Hurricane Olivia. Besides these two systems, Hurricane Agatha caused the
sinking of a ship carrying millions of dollars worth of cargo.[6][7] Tropical
Storm Eleanor caused no serious impact.[4]

The most devastating storm of the season was Hurricane Olivia. A late-season
major hurricane, Olivia [came ashore](/wiki/Landfall_\(meteorology\) "Landfall
\(meteorology\)") near [Mazatlán](/wiki/Mazatl%C3%A1n "Mazatlán").[4] The
storm killed 30 people, left around 30,000 people homeless,[8] and caused 20
million dollars (1975 [USD](/wiki/United_States_Dollar "United States
Dollar")) in damage.[4]

Duration| June 2 – June 5  
Peak intensity| 80 mph (130 km/h) (1-min);  
≤1005 [mbar](/wiki/Bar_\(unit\) "Bar \(unit\)") ([hPa](/wiki/Pascal_\(unit\)
"Pascal \(unit\)"))  
  
An area of disturbed weather about 290 mi (467 km) southwest of
[Acapulco](/wiki/Acapulco "Acapulco") formed on June 1. It organized into a
tropical depression the next day. After heading southwestward, it turned to
the northwest and strengthened into Tropical Storm Agatha on June 2. Agatha
maintained its course and steadily intensified. It reached hurricane intensity
on June 3 while located about 170 mi (270 km) southwest of
[Zihuatanejo](/wiki/Zihuatanejo,_Guerrero "Zihuatanejo, Guerrero"). Hurricane
Agatha started weakening thereafter, becoming a tropical storm on June 4 and a
depression on June 5. It dissipated shortly afterwards. At this time, Agatha
was located about 140 mi (230 km) south of the [Tres Marias
Islands](/wiki/Tres_Marias_Islands "Tres Marias Islands").[4]

Even though Agatha passed close to Mexico as it weakened, no impact is known
to have been caused.[4] Waves caused by Agatha did impact a ship called the
_Polynesian Diakan_. A Greek freighter en route from [Pago
Pago](/wiki/Pago_Pago,_American_Samoa "Pago Pago, American Samoa") to
[Terminal Island, California](/wiki/Terminal_Island,_California "Terminal
Island, California"), the _Polynesian Diakan_ began flooding on June 3,
forcing the 32-man crew to abandon the vessel.[6] The exact cause of the
initial flooding was unknown, but was speculated to be primarily due to [cargo
shifting](/w/index.php?title=Cargo_shifting&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cargo
shifting \(page does not exist\)") and not the weather.[9] The crew was
rescued by the [United States Coast Guard](/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard
"United States Coast Guard").[6] Three members required hospitalization.[9]
After being reached on June 6 by a tugboat in a salvage attempt, the vessel
capsized and sank near [San Clemente Island](/wiki/San_Clemente_Island "San
Clemente Island") on June 7, taking its multimillion-dollar cargo of 71
containers of canned [tuna](/wiki/Tuna "Tuna") with it. The reason for the
sinking was unknown.[7]

Duration| June 28 – July 3  
Peak intensity| 65 mph (100 km/h) (1-min);  
  
  
On June 27, a tropical depression formed about 575 mi (925 km) south of the
tip of the [Baja California Peninsula](/wiki/Baja_California_Peninsula "Baja
California Peninsula") at a location atypical for [tropical
cyclogenesis](/wiki/Tropical_cyclogenesis "Tropical cyclogenesis"). The
depression moved generally westward, and intensified into Tropical Storm
Bridget on June 28. It started accelerating as it turned towards the
northwest, then west, and eventually to the southwest. Bridget weakened into a
tropical depression on July 2 and dissipated the next day. It remnant
circulation hung about in the area for a few more days. Bridget never came
near land and thus, no deaths or damage were recorded.[4]

Peak intensity| 125 mph (205 km/h) (1-min);  
  
  
A disturbance 480 mi (772 km) south of [Acapulco](/wiki/Acapulco "Acapulco")
organized into a tropical depression on July 2. It headed generally west-
northwest and steadily intensified, becoming a tropical storm later on July 2.
It became a hurricane on July 3 and ultimately peaked as a [Category
3](/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale "Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale")
hurricane.[4] Hurricane Carlotta was first major hurricane, Category 3 or
higher, of the season.[2] It began weakening thereafter, and was a tropical
storm by July 8. Carlotta became a depression on July 10 and dissipated the
next day.[4] The hurricane did not come near land and caused no significant
impact.[4]

Duration| July 5 – July 15  
Peak intensity| 140 mph (220 km/h) (1-min);  
  
  
An unstable area developed a circulation and became a tropical depression on
July 4. It headed west- northwest and became a tropical storm on July 7. The
next day, it was a hurricane and turned to the west. Continuing to strengthen,
it reached Category 4 intensity on July 9.[4] This windspeed was the highest
of the season.[2] The hurricane turned to the southwest and gradually
weakened. By July 11 it was nearly stationary. It then headed northwestward
again and continued weakening, becoming a tropical storm on July 13. It
weakened into a depression on July 14 and dissipated immediately thereafter.
Denise brought winds of near-[gale](/wiki/Gale "Gale") force to parts of
[Mexico](/wiki/Mexico "Mexico"), but otherwise caused no damage or
casualties.[4]

An area of disturbed weather developed into a tropical depression on July 10,
100 mi (160 km) south of [Acapulco](/wiki/Acapulco "Acapulco"). As its [center
of circulation](/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation "Atmospheric circulation")
became more pronounced and it was upgraded into Tropical Storm Eleanor. The
tropical storm moved northwestward, and later curved northward. The system
made landfall near Manzanillo on July 12. It quickly dissipated. Eleanor
brought 20 mph (32 km/h) winds the Manzanillo, but damage from the storm is
minor due to the lack of heavy rains.[4]

A rapidly moving [squally](/wiki/Squall "Squall") area of disturbed weather
that was moving on a northwestward path was upgraded into Tropical Depression
Seven on July 27. It intensified into a tropical storm later that day.
Francene turned to the west and weakened into a tropical depression on July
28. It slowly weakened and ceased to exist as a [tropical
cyclone](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone "Tropical cyclone") on July 30. Francene's
remnants persisted as a tropical disturbance for another twelve hours, before
completely dissipating. This tropical cyclone caused no known impact.[4]

An area of disturbed weather about 800 mi (1,287 km) south-southwest of [Cabo
San Lucas](/wiki/Cabo_San_Lucas "Cabo San Lucas") organized a tropical
depression on August 11. It was upgraded to tropical storm intensity the next
day. After heading generally westward and peaking as a weak to moderate
tropical storm on August 12, Georgette slowly weakened.[4] It weakened into a
depression on August 14 and underwent [extratropical
transition](/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone "Extratropical cyclone") thereafter.
The cyclone dissipated twelve hours later.[2] Tropical Storm Georgette had no
impact on land.[4]

Peak intensity| 60 mph (95 km/h) (1-min);  
  
  
A tropical disturbance formed on August 11 and gradually organized. The next
day, an [atmospheric circulation](/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation "Atmospheric
circulation") developed. Based on this, this system was classified as Tropical
Depression Nine on August 13. The depression quickly intensified into a
tropical storm and was named _Hilary_. The system gradually accelerated to the
northwest[4] and reached its peak strength on August 15 with winds of 60 mph
(95 km/h).[2] Tropical Storm Hilary then started a gradual weakening trend. It
became a depression on August 16, turned a little bit more westward, and
dissipated on August 17. Hilary never came near land, and as such caused no
death or damage.[4]

Duration| August 18 – August 26  
Peak intensity| 105 mph (165 km/h) (1-min);  
  
  
On August 18, a tropical depression formed south of the [Gulf of
Tehuantepec](/wiki/Gulf_of_Tehuantepec "Gulf of Tehuantepec") from a [tropical
wave](/wiki/Tropical_wave "Tropical wave") that had entered the Pacific Ocean
from the [Atlantic Ocean](/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean"). It
strengthened into a tropical storm later that day. The tropical storm moved
westward, and became a hurricane on August 21.[4] Ilsa became a [Category 2
hurricane](/wiki/Saffir-Simpson_Hurricane_Scale "Saffir-Simpson Hurricane
Scale") on August 22. It maintained that intensity for three days as it moved
out to sea.[2] On August 25, Ilsa turned westward and rapidly weakened. It
fell to tropical storm intensity on August 26. Later that day, while still
maintaining winds of [gale](/wiki/Gale "Gale")-force, Ilsa ceased being a
tropical cyclone.[2] Ilsa's remnants continued out over the open [Pacific
Ocean](/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean").[4] The remains of Ilsa eventually
interacted with another weather system. That triggered the development of the
unnamed hurricane of August 31–September 5[5]

Hurricane Ilsa caused no casualties or damage.[4] As the unnamed hurricane
formed from Ilsa's remnants,[5] Ilsa and the latter system are unofficially
the same tropical cyclone. Indeed, this year's seasonal report from the
[Redwood City](/wiki/Redwood_City,_California "Redwood City, California")
[Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center](/wiki/Eastern_Pacific_Hurricane_Center
"Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center"), in the _[Monthly Weather
Review](/wiki/Monthly_Weather_Review "Monthly Weather Review")_ includes a
brief discussion of the unnamed hurricane in the report's section on Hurricane
Ilsa.[4] Neither the [Central Pacific Hurricane
Center](/wiki/Central_Pacific_Hurricane_Center "Central Pacific Hurricane
Center")[10] nor the official [HURDAT](/wiki/HURDAT "HURDAT") "best track"
database of tropical cyclone location and intensity data explicitly considers
them the same. Hence, as far as official records matter, Ilsa and the unnamed
hurricane of August 31 – September 5 are different tropical cyclones.[2][5]

On August 24, a tropical depression formed from a tropical disturbance about
250 mi (400 km) south of [Acapulco](/wiki/Acapulco "Acapulco"). It intensified
into Tropical Storm Jewel the next day. The [tropical
cyclone](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone "Tropical cyclone") headed generally northwest
and paralleled the coast of Mexico.[4] On August 27, Jewel became a hurricane
for mere six hours,[2] the minimum possible time in [HURDAT](/wiki/HURDAT
"HURDAT").[11] Jewel then turned to the west, and then back to the northwest.
Jewel weakened to depression strength on August 31. Tropical Depression Jewel
dissipated shortly after that, although its remnants remained distinct until
September 3. There was no impact.[4]

Peak intensity| 130 mph (215 km/h) (1-min);  
  
  
On August 29, an area of weather developed directly into a tropical storm,
skipping the tropical depression stage.[2] Katrina steadily intensified as it
headed west-northwest, gradually turning to the northwest. It peaked in
intensity on September 3 as a [Category 4](/wiki/Saffir-
Simpson_Hurricane_Scale "Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale") hurricane with winds
of 130 mph (209 km/h), the second highest of the season.[2] Katrina then
headed westward and rapidly weakened. It was downgraded into a tropical storm
on September 5 and a depression on September 6. The last advisory was issued
on September 7 when Katrina dissipated. Although the hurricane brought
Category 3-equivalent winds to [Socorro Island](/wiki/Socorro_Island "Socorro
Island") on September 2, no damage was reported there or anywhere else.[4]

The remnants of Hurricane Ilsa interacted with a mid-level trough to produce a
new low-level circulation on August 31, about 930 miles (1,500 km) northeast
of Hawaii. The new system absorbed the remnants of Ilsa as it moved westward.
Thunderstorms increased around the low, resembling a [subtropical
cyclone](/wiki/Subtropical_cyclone "Subtropical cyclone") by September 1. Its
track over warmer waters caused the storm to transition into a tropical storm
on September 2, by which time the convection organized into rainbands. By that
time, the storm was about 685 miles (1,102 km) north of the Hawaiian island of
[Kauai](/wiki/Kauai "Kauai"). The storm quickly developed a [central dense
overcast](/wiki/Central_dense_overcast "Central dense overcast"), and by 00:00
UTC on September 3 [Dvorak classifications](/wiki/Dvorak_technique "Dvorak
technique") began on the cyclone. An approaching cold front turned the storm
to the north and northeast. Around that time, the storm developed an eye in
the center of the convection, suggesting that it intensified into a hurricane
late on September 3, located about 1,170 miles (1,885 km) south of
[Alaska](/wiki/Alaska "Alaska"). It was a small system, measuring about 85
miles (140 km) in diameter.[12] A nearby ship reported sustained winds of 63
mph (102 km/h), while another nearby ship reported a pressure of 1003
[mbar](/wiki/Bar_\(unit\) "Bar \(unit\)") (29.6 [inHg](/wiki/Inch_of_mercury
"Inch of mercury")), with a 3-hour tendency increase of 13.5 mbar (0.40 inHg),
suggesting a minimum pressure of under 990 mbar (29 inHg).[4][12][13] After
maintaining hurricane status for about 18 hours, the storm weakened due to
strong wind shear from the approaching cold front. Early on September 5, the
cyclone became [extratropical](/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone "Extratropical
cyclone") in the [Gulf of Alaska](/wiki/Gulf_of_Alaska "Gulf of Alaska"),
while located about 315 miles (510 km) southwest of [Juneau](/wiki/Juneau
"Juneau"), Alaska. On the same day, the circulation was rapidly absorbed by
the frontal system,[13] and the remnants quickly reached the coast of [British
Columbia](/wiki/British_Columbia "British Columbia").[5][12] The remnants of
the storm turned southeastward, and the low was last tracked definitively to a
point north of [Montana](/wiki/Montana "Montana").[13]

Peak intensity| 85 mph (140 km/h) (1-min);  
  
  
Rain and wind reports from the [Acapulco](/wiki/Acapulco "Acapulco") weather
station suggested that a tropical depression was developing. This was
confirmed on September 16 from ship reports. It intensified into a tropical
storm and was named Lily. Tropical Storm Lily headed northwest in a nearly
straight path. By 0000 [UTC](/wiki/UTC "UTC") September 18, the system was a
moderate tropical storm located about 160 mi (260 km) south of
[Manzanillo](/wiki/Manzanillo,_Colima "Manzanillo, Colima") Lily was upgraded
to hurricane status on the same day and eventually reached its peak strength.
After passing southwest of [Socorro Island](/wiki/Socorro_Island "Socorro
Island"), Lily weakened, becoming a storm on September 20. Lily weakened into
a depression on September 21, turned to the west-southwest, and dissipated.
Its remnants remained visible until September 24, when they were no longer
distinct via [weather satellite](/wiki/Weather_satellite "Weather satellite").
On September 19, the cyclone brought hurricane-force winds to Socorro Island.
No damage or casualties were reported.[4]

Peak intensity| 50 mph (85 km/h) (1-min);  
  
  
In late September, three tropical disturbances moved westward across the
eastern [Pacific Ocean](/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean"). One of them
organized into a tropical depression on September 28. The next day the
depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Monica. The tropical storm initially
headed west-northwestward and gradually curved towards the north. It reached
its peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h) on September 29. Monica then gradually
weakened. It became a tropical depression on October 1. The cyclone dissipated
shortly thereafter. No impact was reported in association with Tropical Storm
Monica.[4]

On September 28, a system developed into a tropical depression, simultaneously
with Tropical Storm Monica.. It headed generally westward and on September 29,
18 hours after Monica did it, strengthened into a tropical storm.[2][4]
Nanette continued out to sea and slowly strengthened. It peaked in windspeed
of 50 mph (85 km/h) on October 3 and turned to the southwest. It then slowly
weakened. On October 4, it weakened into a tropical depression and then
degenerated into a disturbance that same day. No damage or deaths were
reported.[4]

Main article: [Hurricane Olivia (1975)](/wiki/Hurricane_Olivia_\(1975\)
"Hurricane Olivia \(1975\)")

On October 22, Tropical Depression Eighteen formed from a cluster of three
thunderstorms south of Mexico and then strengthened into a tropical storm.[4]
It moved northwestward initially, followed by a northeast turn. Olivia then
intensified steadily. It reached [Category 3](/wiki/Saffir-
Simpson_Hurricane_Scale "Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale") intensity and a peak
of 115 mph (185 km/h) winds just before landfall. Early on October 25, Olivia
moved ashore just south of [Mazatlán](/wiki/Mazatl%C3%A1n "Mazatlán") causing
major damage. Olivia destroyed 7,000 houses in the region,[4] leaving 30,000
people homeless,[14] and damage totaled $20 million (1975
[USD](/wiki/United_States_dollar "United States dollar"), $113 million 2024
USD).[4] The hurricane killed 30 people,[15] 20 of them were from drownings in
shrimp boats.[4]

Duration| November 2 – November 7  
Peak intensity| 65 mph (100 km/h) (1-min);  
  
  
A nearly stationary cloudy area developed a
[circulation](/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation "Atmospheric circulation") on
November 2. The depression drifted north for a while before turning to the
west-northwest on November 3. It intensified into a tropical storm on November
4. Priscilla then began turning to the north. However, the system failed to
re-curve, instead, the tropical storm turned generally westward. The tropical
storm peaked in windspeed as a 65 mph (100 km/h) high-end storm on November 5.
It then turned to the northwest on a heading nearly directly at [Clarion
Island](/wiki/Clarion_Island "Clarion Island"), but it dissipated on November
7[2] about 115 mi (185 km) short of landfall.[4]

### Other systems

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=1975_Pacific_hurricane_season&action=edit&section=20
"Edit section: Other systems")]

Besides the tropical storms and hurricanes this season, there were four
additional tropical depressions within the eastern Pacific. None of them made
landfall anywhere or crossed into the central Pacific. Tropical Cyclone Four
formed on July 2 and dissipated the next day. Tropical Cyclone Thirteen formed
on September 12 and lasted four days. Tropical Cyclone Seventeen formed
October 16 and dissipated a day later. Tropical Cyclone Nineteen formed on
November 1 and also dissipated the next day.[4]

## Storm names

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=1975_Pacific_hurricane_season&action=edit&section=21
"Edit section: Storm names")]

Main articles: [Tropical cyclone naming](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone_naming
"Tropical cyclone naming"), [History of tropical cyclone
naming](/wiki/History_of_tropical_cyclone_naming "History of tropical cyclone
naming"), and [List of historical tropical cyclone
names](/wiki/List_of_historical_tropical_cyclone_names "List of historical
tropical cyclone names")

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North
Pacific Ocean east of 140°W in 1975.[16] It was the same list used in the
[1971 season](/wiki/1971_Pacific_hurricane_season "1971 Pacific hurricane
season").[17] No [names were
retired](/wiki/List_of_retired_Pacific_hurricane_names "List of retired
Pacific hurricane names") following the season; however, an overhaul of the
naming system [in 1978](/wiki/1978_Pacific_hurricane_season "1978 Pacific
hurricane season") to include male names resulted in this list being
discarded.[18]

The season's unnamed hurricane was the only tropical cyclone reported in the
North Pacific between 140°W and the International Date Line in 1975.[5][19]
Had the system been named, it would have been assigned one from the west
Pacific's typhoon name list by the [Joint Typhoon Warning
Center](/wiki/Joint_Typhoon_Warning_Center "Joint Typhoon Warning Center") on
[Guam](/wiki/Guam "Guam").[16]
